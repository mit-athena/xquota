Welcome to xquota, an X interface to the unix quota check command.

This program will allow you to easily monitor the quota of your home filesystem.  This help screen will give a general overview of functionality or xquota, and then go into detail of the features of the graphing display.  The features of the popup display are described in the popup window's help screen.

When xquota is started up it finds your home filesystem and then checks the quota of that filesystem.  It will then display your quota in a graphical manner, updating it every once and a while.  If xquota discovers that you are approaching you quota you will be gently reminded of the fact, by the bar graph and current usage display highlighting.  The default is for this to occur when you have used up 80% of your quota If you go over you soft quota xquota will automatically pop the popup display and present you with a stern warning about the folly of going over quota.

Xquota has two displays, the graph display and the popup display.  I will only explain the graphical display here.  The graphical display has three sections.  A numeric display, and bar graph display and a help button.  

The numeric display shows you your soft quota and the amount of space you have currently used up.  The graph display shows the same information on a bar graph.  The amount of space used is shown as a fraction of your soft quota.  The help button will display this message when it is clicked.  

I have kept the amount of information displayed here to a minimum so that this display can be left on your workspace at all times.  It is possible to reduce the amount of information shown here even further, this is explained below.  Event thought the display is quite stark there are some command available from the graphical display.  They are:

Click Left   - Show Popup Window.
Click Middle - Show this help window.
Click Right  - Check Quota.

That is about all the basic functionality, for information on the popup display read it's help screen. 

Customization

This is described in detail in the manual page, xquota(1) but here is a quick overview. 

-nonumbers : numbers and Numbers resources

This allows the numbers to be removed from the graphical display.

-savespace : saveSpace and SaveSpace resources

These remove everything but the bar graph from the graphical display.

-warning # : warning and Warning resources

When this percentage of you quota is reached you will be gently reminded that you are approaching you quota.

-update # : update and Update resources

This resources is the number of minutes that xquota should wait before making another quota check

As well as these application specific resources, all X toolkit resources are observed allowing lots of customization.  The manual page will explain this is
further detail.
